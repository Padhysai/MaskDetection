### Overview
The utility of masks during the Covid-19 pandemic seems widely accepted now. The dominant scientific opinion says masks are very useful, and even relatively simple home-made masks can offer a great degree of protection against the novel coronavirus. With several countries like Singapore, Japan, states, and cities in the United States like Texas and New York making wearing masks mandatory for the public there comes a need for an automated system that is capable of helping authorities maintain guidelines which is where we can hope to turn to computer vision for a solution.

### Architecture
Google has released [Object detection API for tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection), it comes with several pre-trained models with pre-implemented architectures which are trained on COCO dataset.
